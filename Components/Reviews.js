The moment you walk in to this restaurant right away you feels like been taken away to the local Villages and invited for a village feast. All the foods are traditional and authentic. For visitors you must go in with open mind with their foods and flavour. Most dishes aren’t too spicy. Friendly staff !! Have chickens running around the ground which are fun to watch. This is a great SL experience for sure !!'
